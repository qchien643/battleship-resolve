# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
AI Battleship exists to provide an engaging and challenging single-player Battleship experience. It serves as a modern take on the classic board game, allowing players to enjoy Battleship without needing a human opponent. The project also showcases practical applications of AI in game development.

## Problems It Solves
- Enables solo play of a traditionally two-player game
- Provides a consistent challenge level that can be adjusted as needed
- Makes Battleship accessible without physical game components
- Creates an opportunity to demonstrate AI decision-making in a familiar context

## How It Should Work
1. The player starts a new game and is presented with a placement phase
2. Players arrange their ships on their board according to classic Battleship rules
3. Once ships are placed, gameplay alternates between player and AI turns:
   - Player selects a coordinate to attack on the AI's board
   - Results of the attack (hit, miss, sink) are displayed
   - AI selects a coordinate to attack on the player's board
   - Results are displayed
4. Play continues until either all of the player's or all of the AI's ships are sunk
5. Game concludes with a win/loss screen and option to play again

## User Experience Goals
- **Intuitive Interface**: Players should understand how to play without instruction
- **Immediate Feedback**: Clear visual and textual feedback for all actions
- **Strategic Depth**: AI should provide enough challenge to make the game engaging
- **Satisfaction**: Hitting and sinking ships should feel rewarding
- **Fairness**: AI should follow the same rules as the player (no cheating)
- **Efficiency**: Game should load quickly and respond immediately to user input
