# Project Brief: AI Battleship

## Overview
AI Battleship is a modern implementation of the classic Battleship game with two gameplay modes:
1. **Single-player** - Play against an AI opponent
2. **Two-player** - Play against another human with probability mapping

The project aims to create an engaging, interactive game where players can test their strategic skills either against an intelligent computer opponent or against another player with the assistance of probability calculations.

## Core Requirements

### General Requirements
- Interactive game board for ship placement and attacks
- Classic Battleship gameplay rules
- Turn-based gameplay with clear feedback
- Win/loss condition tracking

### Single-player Mode
- AI opponent with strategic ship placement and attack planning
- Multiple AI difficulty levels

### Two-player Mode
- Customizable grid size (m√ón)
- Configurable ship lengths (e.g., [2, 2, 3, 4, 5], [3, 3, 3, 3], [2, 4, 5])
- Probability map calculation after each shot
- Turn sequence management between players

## Goals
- Create an entertaining and challenging game experience
- Implement smart AI strategies for single-player mode
- Develop an accurate probability calculation system for two-player mode
- Develop a clean, intuitive user interface
- Ensure the game is responsive and accessible

## Scope
- Single-player mode against AI
- Two-player mode with probability mapping
- Standard or customizable Battleship grid
- Classic ship set with configurable options
- Web-based implementation

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
- Multiplayer online functionality (beyond local two-player)
- Mobile app versions
- 3D graphics or animations
- Variations on classic Battleship rules
