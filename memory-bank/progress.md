# Progress

## What Works
- Project planning has been completed
- Documentation established in the memory bank
- Project requirements defined for both single-player and two-player modes

## What's Left to Build
- [x] Project planning and documentation
- [ ] Basic project setup (React/TypeScript)
- [ ] Customizable game board component
- [ ] Ship models and placement logic
- [ ] Turn-based game loop
- [ ] Player attack functionality

### Single-Player Mode
- [ ] AI ship placement
- [ ] AI attack strategies
- [ ] AI difficulty settings

### Two-Player Mode
- [ ] Customizable grid size implementation
- [ ] Configurable ship lengths
- [ ] Probability calculation algorithm
- [ ] Probability map visualization
- [ ] Turn management between players

### Common Features
- [ ] Win/loss detection
- [ ] Game UI and styling
- [ ] Ship placement interface
- [ ] Game feedback (hits, misses, sunk ships)
- [ ] Score tracking
- [ ] Game reset and replay functionality
- [ ] Sound effects and visual feedback
- [ ] Responsive design
- [ ] Accessibility features
- [ ] Final testing and bug fixes

## Current Status
Project is in the planning phase with updated requirements for a two-player mode with probability mapping.

## Known Issues
None at this stage as implementation has not started.

## Milestones

### Milestone 1: Core Game Mechanics
