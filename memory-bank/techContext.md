# Technical Context

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **Language**: JavaScript/TypeScript
- **Framework**: React
- **Styling**: CSS/SCSS
- **State Management**: React Context API or Redux

### Development Tools
- **Version Control**: Git
- **Package Manager**: npm/yarn
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Linting**: ESLint
- **Formatting**: Prettier
- **Testing**: Jest and React Testing Library

## Development Setup
The project is set up as a standard React application with the following structure:
```
/
├── public/              # Static assets
├── src/
│   ├── components/      # UI components
│   ├── models/          # Data models and types
│   ├── services/        # Game logic and AI
│   ├── utils/           # Helper functions
│   ├── assets/          # Images, sounds, etc.
│   ├── styles/          # Global styles
│   ├── App.tsx          # Main application component
│   └── main.tsx         # Entry point
├── package.json         # Dependencies and scripts
├── tsconfig.json        # TypeScript configuration
└── vite.config.js       # Build configuration
```

## Technical Constraints
- Must support modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Should be responsive for different screen sizes
- Must maintain accessibility standards (WAI-ARIA)
- Game logic should be testable and maintainable
- AI decisions should execute quickly without noticeable delays

## Dependencies
- React (core UI framework)
- TypeScript (type safety)
- Vite (fast build tooling)
- Testing libraries (Jest, React Testing Library)

## Performance Considerations
- Board rendering should be optimized for frequent updates
- AI decision-making algorithm should be efficient
- Game state updates should be batched when possible
- Assets should be optimized for web delivery

## Technical Decisions
- Using TypeScript for improved maintainability and type safety
- Component-based architecture for UI reusability
- Separation of game logic from presentation
- Pure functions for game rules to simplify testing
- AI strategies implemented as pluggable modules
